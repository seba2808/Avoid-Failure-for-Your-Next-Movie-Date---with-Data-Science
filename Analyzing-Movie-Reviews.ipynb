    "## 1. Objective\n",

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately [some of these site have been blamed recently](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) that their scores are biased. Especially Fandango has been under suspicion to use a score aggregation mechanisms that put movies in a better light. As a platform that sells movie tickets, Fandango has an immediate interest in people desire to watch a movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we would like to take a data science based approach to see if this rumor holds water of not. So for your next movie date you know if you can trust the data or not and hopefully avoid failure.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. The Approach and the Dataset\n",
    "For this analysis we will use a data set originally developed by [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/). The dataset is stored in the fandango_score_comparison.csv file. It contains information on how major movie review services have rated movies."

    "Each row represents a single movie. Each column contains information about how the online movie review services `RottenTomatoes`, `Metacritic`, `IMDB`, and Fandango rated the movie. Each of these sites has 2 types of score -- User scores, which aggregate user reviews, and Critic score, which aggregate professional critical reviews of the movie. Each service puts their ratings on a different scale:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `RottenTomatoes` - 0-100, in increments of 1.\n",
    " - `Metacritic` - 0-100, in increments of 1.\n",
    " - `IMDB` - 0-10, in increments of .1.\n",
    " - 'Fandango' - 0-5, in increments of .5.\n",
    "Typically, the primary score shown by the sites will be the Critic score. Here are descriptions of some of the relevant columns in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `FILM` | The name of the movie |\n",
    "| `RottenTomatoes` | The RottenTomatoes (RT) critic score |\n",
    "| `RottenTomatoes_User` | The RT user score |\n",
    "| `Metacritic` | The Metacritic critic score |\n",
    "| `Metacritic_User` | The Metacritic user score |\n",
    "| `IMDB` | The IMDB score given to the movie |\n",
    "| `Fandango_Stars` | The number of stars Fandango gave the movie |\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to compare scores across services, the columns were normalized so their scale and rounding matched the Fandango ratings. Any column with the suffix `_norm` is the corresponding column changed to a 0-5 scale. For example, `RT_norm` takes the `RottenTomatoes` column and turns it into a 0-5 scale from a 0-100 scale. Any column with the suffix `_round` is the rounded version of another column. For example, `RT_user_norm_round` rounds the `RT_user_norm column` to the nearest .5\n",

    "For this analysis we'll primarily focus on the `Metacritic_norm_round` and the `Fandango_Stars` columns, which will let us see how `Fandango` and `Metacritic` differ in terms of review scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will perform a few statistical analysis on the data to find out any potential bias.\n",
    "Here the steps that we will perform:\n",
    "1. Create a histogram with the score distribution and compare the two services\n",
    "2. Calculate the relevant statistical indicators including standard deviation, median to describe the data sets\n",
    "3. Draw a scatter plot to see if there is a correlation between the scores of the services\n",
    "5. Identify the movies with the largest deviation in scores between the two services\n",
