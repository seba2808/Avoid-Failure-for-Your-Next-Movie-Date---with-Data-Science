# Avoiding Movie Date Failure
When you pick the movie for your next movie date, you want to be sure to pick a good one. If you do your research you revert to the movie critics sites such as Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDB and Fandango.

Unfortunately some of these site have been blamed recently that their scores are biased. Especially Fandango has been under suspicion to use a score aggregation mechanisms that put movies in a better light. As a platform that sells movie tickets, Fandango has an immediate interest in people desire to watch a movie.

In this analysis, we would like to take a data science based approach to see if this rumor holds water of not. So for your next movie date you know if you can trust the data or not and hopefully avoid failure.
